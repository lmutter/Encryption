# Encryption
Simple encryption and decryption in java.

Enter the amount of random characters you would like to generate at the bottom to create a key. Alternatively,
enter your own key into the box labelled "Key."

Next, enter your message to encode into the "Message" box. Click encode and your message will be encoded using a VERY secret
method that not even the top hackers at anonymous could figure out. It's that secure. Your message might as well have been
locked away in a vault inside the center of a mountain in the alps, gaurded by 1500 armed gaurds and several dozen nuclear
warheads pointed at the hacker's exact coordinates.

If you ever want to crack open that encrypted data, again only possible through your key, just put the text to decode in the
"Message" box with the same key you used to encode it in the key box. Boddabing, boddaboom.
